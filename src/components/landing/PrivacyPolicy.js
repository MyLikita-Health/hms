          <h6>Uses and Disclosures of Protected Health Information</h6>
          <p>
            Your Protected Health Information may be used and disclosed by your
            physician, our office staff and others outside of our office that
            are involved in your care and treatment for the purpose of providing
            health care services to you, to pay your health care bills, to
            support the operation of the practice, and any other use required by
            law.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Treatment:</strong> We will use and disclose your Protected
            Health Information to provide, coordinate, or manage your health
            care and any related services. This includes the coordination or
            management of your health care with a third party. For example, your
            protected health information may be provided to a physician to whom
            you have been referred to ensure that the health care professional
            has the necessary information to diagnose or treat you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Payment:</strong> Your protected health information will be
            used, as needed, to obtain payment for health care services. For
            example, obtaining approval for a hospital stay may require that
            your relevant protected health information be disclosed to the
            health plan to obtain approval for the hospital admission.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Healthcare Operations:</strong> We may use or disclose,
            as-needed, your protected health information in order to support the
            business activities of your physician’s practice. These activities
            include, but are not limited to, quality assessment activities,
            employee review activities, and conducting or arranging for other
            business activities. We may use or disclose, as needed, your
            protected health information to support the business activities of
            this practice. In addition, we may use a sign-in sheet at the
            registration desk where you will be asked to sign your name and
            indicate your physician. We may also call you by name in the waiting
            room when your physician is ready to see you. We may use or disclose
            your protected health information, as necessary, to contact you to
            remind you of your appointment. We may call your home and leave a
            message (either on an answering machine or with the person answering
            the phone) to remind you of an upcoming appointment, the need to
            schedule a new appointment or to call our office. We may also mail a
            postcard reminder to your home address. If you would prefer that we
            call or contact you at another telephone number or location, please
            let us know.

            You have the right to request a restriction of your health

            request. If your physician believes it is in your best interest to
            permit use and disclosure of your protected health information, your
            protected health information will not be restricted. You then have
            the right to use another Healthcare Professional.
